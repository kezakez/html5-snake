used qunit for testing.
jcanvas for drawing.
tdd made it really nice and clean.
30 mins to work out testing
60 mins to get logic
60 mins to get drawing and keys and extra logic.

Simple Part: 
- create a simple Snakes game using HTML5 
- the game starts when the user presses the space bar. A snake (string 
of attached squares) keeps moving in a big enough rectangular region 
in straight direction 
- using the arrow keys the user can change the direction of the snake, 
left or right 
- the challenge for the user is to not touch the boundary of the 
rectangular region 
- if the user touches the rectangle, the game ends 
- to know what a snake game is, please refer to http://www.snakegame.net/neavesnake.htm 
- add music at the background and sound effects when the snake touches 
the rectangular region 
Complex part: (Optional. if you complete simple part and want to take 
up something more challenging) 
- place food (single squares) randomly in the rectangular region 
- if the snake passes through the food, add one square extra to the 
length of the snake
